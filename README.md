# directory-manager for Endpoint
1- Because one of the requirements is to not create phyiscal folders I created them in-memory (dictionary data structure)

2- The Directoty class code is in directories.py and can be run with command: 'python directories.py'

3- User can exit the command listener by typing Exit.

4- I also added extra unit tests for all 4 cases (Create, Delete, Move, List) in test_directories.py file and can be run with command 'python test_directories.py'

5- I added comments where I felt it might be needed to understand the effect of the line code.

6- I added excepton handler where the code was consuming other methods and there might be a chance of thrown exceptions.
